# Golang-DigitalOcean-API

  My main goal with this project is to create a sort of version of Godo that is more userfriendly for those of us who are technically minded but still in the learning process. A more detailed README, directions, documentation, et cetera. I would also love ideas about that from anyone who has gone through learning about APIs, Go, Ubuntu, all of it. It's all still new to me and I learn by doing: so I'm attempting to do this. :)

  I am currently learning how to configure and use Go with Ubuntu 18.04, for the purpose of learning and using DigitalOcean's (and other APIs) APIv2.  I'm trying to achieve this with DigitalOcean's Godo (<a href="http://www.github.com/digitalocean/godo">here's the repository</a>. Any advice would be appreciated.
